The `DictionaryOperationsTests` class within the `LinqCollectionsDemo` namespace contains two test methods to demonstrate basic operations and enumeration on a `Dictionary<string, int>` in C#.

1. **TestAddUpdateDictTest**: This method demonstrates adding key-value pairs to the dictionary, updating values, and checking for keys and values. It verifies the updated value and the existence of keys and values within the dictionary using assertions.

2. **EnumerateDictionaryTest**: This method showcases how to enumerate through the keys and values of a dictionary. It updates a value, iterates through the dictionary using tuple deconstruction, and builds strings from the keys and values to verify the contents of the dictionary through assertions.
