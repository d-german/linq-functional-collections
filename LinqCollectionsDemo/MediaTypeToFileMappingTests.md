The `MediaTypeToFileMappingTests` class contains three test methods to validate different strategies for mapping media types to file names. The `MediaTypeToFileImperative` method tests imperative approaches using a switch statement and multiple if statements. The `MediaTypeToFileExpressive` method examines declarative approaches utilizing a dictionary lookup and a switch expression. The `MediaTypeToFileExpressiveNoDefault` method specifically tests the behavior when an unrecognized media type is provided to a declarative method without a default fallback, expecting a `KeyNotFoundException` to be thrown. Through these tests, the class effectively contrasts imperative and declarative programming styles in the context of a simple mapping task.
