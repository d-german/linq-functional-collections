The `SearchAlgorithmTests` class within the `LinqCollectionsDemo` namespace is structured to demonstrate various properties and methods associated with the `Array` class in C#. It initializes a static array of integers (`Values`), a search value (`SearchValue`), and a sorted version of the array (`SortedValues`). These static fields are initialized using a static constructor which employs the `Array.Copy` and `Array.Sort` methods, alongside a custom method `GetRandomArray` to populate `Values` with random numbers.

The class also defines setup (`Init`) and teardown (`Cleanup`) methods to manage a `Stopwatch` instance for timing the execution of the tests. Two search algorithms, `LinearSearch` and `Array.BinarySearch`, are demonstrated and tested within this class. The `LinearSearch` method is defined within the class, while `Array.BinarySearch` is utilized directly in the `BinarySearchTest` method. The `LinearSearch` method employs the `GetEnumerator` method of the `Array` class to iterate through the array and find the specified value. Two NUnit tests, `LinearSearchValuesTest` and `BinarySearchTest`, verify the correctness of these search algorithms by asserting that the search value can be found within the respective arrays.
